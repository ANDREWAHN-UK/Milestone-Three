# MILESTONE PROJECT THREE

**1. Purpose of the project:**
 - - - -


When I was living in Spain, I ran an [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/18222301), which is still in operation. Naturally I now use agents to run it. Airbnb has a feature called [Guide Books](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/s/guidebooks?refinement_paths[]=/guidebooks/134487) , which is something the host can upload, as an adjunct to the listing. When I set up the listing, I started the guidebook, but quickly realised that to do it well would be extremely time intensive, especially considering that the area in question, if one considers just the beach, is 3 miles long. That means very many restaurants, bars etc.

 I had the onerous task of trying most of them. 

With Milestone Project 3, it seemed a natural idea to ask the guests to register on this review site (along with friends still there) and leave reviews, for future guests. In other words, a version of [Trip Advisor](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/) made by guests, for guests, that other people can view.

Limiting the scope like this has the advantages of users being already interested (As it sparks good memories of their stay or gives them ideas for future stays) and also makes my job as a host considerably easier, as approximately one in three guests asks for a place to eat or drink. By default, I recommend the closest (very good) [Italian restaurant](https://ristorantepiemonte.com/) but being able to present them with a semi-curated and useful guide would uplift their experience.
It is potentially good advertising for the listing in question, which has in excess of 100 very positive reviews.

**2. User Goals/stories**
 - - - -

 * As a **Potential Employer** for a Coding Role, I want to view Andrew’s website, to see how he performs as a Full stack developer. I want to be able to navigate the website and compare it to others, of similar scope.
* As a **Potential Employer** for a Coding Role, further to the above, I would be particularly interested in the use of Python and Flask in this website.
* As a **Potential new visitor** to Las Palmas, specifically this Airbnb listing, I want to be able to read reviews, so I can decide where to go eat/drink
* As a **returning visitor** I want to see what is new, to inform future visits.
* As a **previous visitor who has patronised the area** I want to be able to create, update and delete my own reviews, so as ensure other people are aware of the good and perhaps not so good establishments.
* As a **resident of the area** I want to be able to create, update and delete my own reviews, so as ensure other people are aware of the good and perhaps not so good establishments.
* As an **adminstrator of the website** I want to be able to update and delete other peoples' reviews and profiles.

**4. Typography and colour scheme:**
 - - - -
*	Font - Lato. For the simple reason that it worked well.
*	Icons - very few icons were used here. I used font awesome for the icons.
*	Colours – I want to emphasise Las Canteras beach, which means lots of sea and beach and sun related colours, and the national colours of the island are yellow, blue, and white. This review site is meant to complement an existing Airbnb listing, which has been decorated in …yellow, blue and white.
*	Images – I sourced the images from google images, Unsplash and the official [Las Canteras beach website](https://www.hellocanaryislands.com/beaches/gran-canaria/las-canteras-beach/), as well as my own images.
